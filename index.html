                <p>I'm broken, do you hear me?
                    I'm blinded, 'cause you are everything I see
                    I'm dancing alone
                    I'm praying that your heart will just turn around
                    And as I walk up to your door
                    My head turns to face the floor
                    'Cause I can't look you in the eyes and say
                    When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight
                    It just won't feel right
                    'Cause I can't love you more than this, yeah
                    When he lays you down, I might just die inside
                    It just don't feel right
                    'Cause I can't love you more than this
                    Can't love you more than this
                    If I'm louder, would you see me?
                    Would you lay down in my arms and rescue me?
                    'Cause we are the same
                    You save me
                    But when you leave, it's gone again
                    And then I see you on the street
                    In his arms, I get weak
                    My body fails, I'm on my knees, praying
                    When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight
                    It just won't feel right
                    'Cause I can't love you more than this, yeah
                    When he lays you down, I might just die inside
                    It just don't feel right
                    'Cause I can't love you more than this
                    Yeah, I've never had the words to say
                    But now I'm asking you to stay
                    For a little while inside my arms
                    And as you close your eyes tonight
                    I pray that you will see the light
                    That's shining from the stars, above
                    (And I say)
                    </p>
